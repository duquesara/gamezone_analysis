# Project Background
Gamezone is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in gaming hardware and consoles, selling directly to consumers across multiple regions. Between 2019 and early 2021, the company experienced significant volatility in demand, creating uncertainty around product performance, marketing effectiveness, and regional sales trends. 

Despite collecting detailed transaction-level data on sales, products, marketing channels, and regions, this data had not been fully leveraged to understand the drivers behind revenue growth and decline. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data to identify trends driving revenue growth and decline and uncover actionable insights that will improve Gamezone's commercial success. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trends Over Time:** Analysis of monthly revenue, order volume, and average order value to identify patterns and to inform revenue forecasting.  
- **Product Performance:** Evaluation of individual product lines to understand top performers, underperforming products, and the drivers behind revenue changes. 
- **Marketing Channel Impact:** Assessment of marketing channel effectiveness (direct, email, social media, etc) on sales trends, highlighting opportunities to optimize marketing spend and improve ROI. 
- **Regional Performance:** Evaluation of revenue trends by region to identify geographic strengths and weaknesses and to inform regional sales strategies.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
